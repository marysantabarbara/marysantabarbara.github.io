# The Group Project

The Collaborative Study organization was created for my ICS 314 Final project. Our project was to create an app that will help Information and Computer Science (ICS) majors to connect with other people and study with them. We were a group of four people and in the picture above there are three of us Neal, Me, and Mariah, while Chad was behind the camera taking the picture. We all created mock-ups, but we used most of Chad's mock-ups at the skeleton for our app and just added some of my mock-ups to add more features.

Throughout our development process, our whole group maintained great communication and great cooperation. I could not have asked for a better team. We all tried our best to perfect our assigned parts. I created user reviews, user groups, and a public chat room. Every time I would finish a feature I felt so accomplished. Then at the end when we finished our app  I felt so proud of submitted project. There is still so much more we can do to perfect our app but for our very first project the experience was amazing.

If you want to know more about our app and our project please go to our homepage linked below.
