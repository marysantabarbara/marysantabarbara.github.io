In the fall semester of 2016, I took ICS 314 - Introduction to Software Development. Within that class, the final project was to create some sort of prototype of a web application students of the University of Hawaii to use. I was assigned a group and we created an app called CS (Collaborative Study). This app allows Computer Science students to connect with their classmates and set up study dates. Our submitted app was great for our first prototype but we still have a long way to go. So now in this current semester, Spring 2017, my team will continue making the app be the best app it can be!

# New Features

## On February 1

As you all know, we are still in early stages of development. We have been working to fix the bugs we had at the end of the Fall semester. The more bugs we started fixing the more features we wanted to add. So going down the list you will se these changes are seem very little but they are actually really big!

- Members can now be added to groups and deleted from groups! Before this feature was disabled but now you can actually make groups.
- Groups can now create study sessions for that group. This will help organize your study groups with the friends you have made.
- Sessions are now searchable cards by class or by title. So if you are in desperate need of a study session, just search one up and get in there.
- Courses on your profile page can be edited and deleted. This way users can properly show their proficiency in each class.
