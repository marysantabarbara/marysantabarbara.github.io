#Real World Group Projects

Picture this, you are back in High School and you were assigned a group to do your final project of the year. This scenario will produce two types of emotions in a student; relief or distress. Most students will grovel at the thought of having to rely on other people but others will love the help. Today, there is Google Docs so everyone can work on one document at the same time from any computer. However, back then you would either have to go over to one of the group memebers house and work on it all together on one computer or e-mail different parts to one member and that member will manually input those parts into one document. Now try to imagine group projects for programming. There are hundreds of files for one software project so how do you manage all of them for one?

##Configuration Management Systems

Programming software is the ultimate group project, so there are multiple methods to manage files in a clean and effective manner. There is a configuration management system called Subversion(SVN), which is very similar to Google Drive, where users can share a folder with each other. For SVN, there is a center repository of files and everyone can get a copy of it and edit that copy and apply those changes to the central repository. The problem with SVN gets a little problematic when multiple developers are working on the same file, unlike Google Doc's multiperson typing. The current popular configuration management system is Git. Git allows everyone to have the same repository and we can edit a file, then push those changes on all of the other repositories. There will not be any problems with people editing the same file.
